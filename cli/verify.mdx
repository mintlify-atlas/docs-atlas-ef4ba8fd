description: Verify a Noir proof
---

The `verify` command verifies a zero-knowledge proof generated by the [`prove`](/cli/prove) command.

## Command Syntax

```bash
provekit-cli verify <verifier_path> <proof_path>
```

## Arguments

<ParamField path="verifier_path" type="string" required>
  Path to the verifier file (`.pkv` file generated by `prepare`)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="proof_path" type="string" required>
  Path to the proof file (`.np` file generated by `prove`)
</ParamField>

## Examples

### Basic Usage

Verify a proof:

```bash
provekit-cli verify noir_proof_scheme.pkv proof.np
```

### Complete Workflow

```bash
# 1. Prepare the circuit
provekit-cli prepare circuit.json

# 2. Generate a proof
provekit-cli prove noir_proof_scheme.pkp inputs.toml

# 3. Verify the proof
provekit-cli verify noir_proof_scheme.pkv proof.np
```

### Verifying Multiple Proofs

Verify different proofs with the same verifier:

```bash
provekit-cli verify scheme.pkv proof1.np
provekit-cli verify scheme.pkv proof2.np
provekit-cli verify scheme.pkv proof3.np
```

## Expected Output

### Successful Verification

If the proof is valid, the command completes silently and returns exit code 0:

```bash
$ provekit-cli verify scheme.pkv proof.np
$ echo $?
0
```

### Failed Verification

If the proof is invalid, you'll see an error:

```
Error: While verifying Noir proof

Caused by:
    Proof verification failed
```

The command returns a non-zero exit code.

### File Loading Errors

If files are missing or corrupted:

```
Error: while reading Provekit Verifier

Caused by:
    No such file or directory (os error 2)
```

## What Happens During Verification

The verify command:

1. Loads the verifier from the PKV file
2. Loads the proof from the NP file (these operations run in parallel)
3. Checks that public inputs match the circuit specification
4. Verifies the WHIR proof
5. Validates all cryptographic commitments

<Info>
The verifier and proof files are loaded in parallel using `rayon::join` for optimal performance.
</Info>

## Verification Guarantees

A successful verification guarantees:

- The prover knew witness values that satisfy the circuit constraints
- The public inputs in the proof are correct
- The proof was generated for this specific circuit
- The proof has not been tampered with

<Warning>
Verification does NOT guarantee that the inputs are meaningful or correct for your application logic. Always validate public inputs separately.
</Warning>

## Performance Considerations

- Verification is typically much faster than proof generation
- The verifier file (PKV) is significantly smaller than the prover file (PKP)
- Memory usage during verification is minimal
- Both files are decompressed during loading

## Inspecting Proof Contents

To view the public inputs contained in a proof, use the [`show-inputs`](/cli/show-inputs) command:

```bash
provekit-cli show-inputs scheme.pkv proof.np
```

## Integration Examples

### Shell Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if provekit-cli verify scheme.pkv proof.np; then
    echo "Proof verified successfully!"
    # Process valid proof...
else
    echo "Proof verification failed!"
    exit 1
fi
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

```yaml
- name: Verify proof
  run: |
    provekit-cli verify scheme.pkv proof.np
    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
      echo "Verification passed"
    else
      echo "Verification failed" >&2
      exit 1
    fi
```

## Troubleshooting

### Verification Fails for Valid Proof

- Ensure the PKV file matches the PKP file used to generate the proof
- Check that both files were generated from the same circuit
- Verify files are not corrupted (regenerate with `prepare` if needed)

### Performance Issues

- Ensure you're using a release build (`--release` flag)
- Check available system memory
- Use Tracy profiling to identify bottlenecks
